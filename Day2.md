### Concepts:

- Scope
- Global Scope

#### Scope:

- Scope refers to the visibility of variables. 

#### Global Scope

- Variables which are defined outside of a function block have <b>Global</b> scope.
- Use let, const or no keyword at all to define Global variables.

#### Local Scope

- Variables which are declared within a block

#### var vs let

- ```var``` keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.
- ```let``` keyword, it's scope is not global if it is declared withing a fiunction.
